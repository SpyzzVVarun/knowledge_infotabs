Conjectured by	conjecture	In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or a proposition which is suspected to be true due to preliminary supporting evidence, but for which no proof or disproof has yet been found. Some conjectures, such as the Riemann hypothesis or Fermat's Last Theorem , have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.	proposition in mathematics that is unproven	wikipedia
