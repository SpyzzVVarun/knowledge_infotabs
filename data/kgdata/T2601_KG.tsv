Coordinates	coordinates	"In geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses one or more numbers, or coordinates , to uniquely determine the position of the points or other geometric elements on a manifold such as Euclidean space. The order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in ""the x -coordinate"". The coordinates are taken to be real numbers in elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice versa ; this is the basis of analytic geometry."

Hangul	hangul	"The Korean alphabet , known as Hangul in South Korea and Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea, was logically and scientifically invented by King Sejong the Great in 1443 to write the Korean language. All basic letters mimic their articulator's shape and phonetic features when pronouncing them, making Hangul the most faithful contemporary featural writing system. In the Hangul orthography, it consists of 24 basic letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters . Originally, it consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters. 4 letters became obsolete: 1 vowel letter and 3 consonant letters . In practice, there are 19 complex letters with 5 tense consonants and 11 complex vowels combining the basic letters. The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic letters arranged in two dimensions. For example, the Korean word for ""honeybee"" is written 꿀벌, not ㄲㅜㄹㅂㅓㄹ. As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an ""alphabetic syllabary."" As in traditional Chinese writing, Korean texts were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left, and are occasionally still written this way for stylistic purposes. Today, it is typically written from left to right with spaces between words and western-style punctuation. It is the official writing system of Korea, including both North and South Korea. It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau, Indonesia. The Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin ."	native alphabet of the Korean language	wikipedia

Hanja	hanja	"Hanja nt͈ɕa]) is the Korean name for an old writing system consisting mainly of Traditional Chinese characters in China) that was incorporated and used since the Gojoseon period . More specifically, it refers to the Traditional Chinese characters incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. Hanja-eo refers to words that can be written with Hanja, and hanmun refers to Classical Chinese writing. Although ""Hanja"" is sometimes also used loosely to encompass these concepts. Because Hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to traditional Chinese and kyūjitai characters, though the stroke orders for some characters are slightly different. For example, the characters 教 and 研 are written as 敎 and 硏. Only a small number of Hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding Hanja characters. According to the Standard Korean Language Dictionary , published by the National Institute of Korean Language , out of the approximately 510,000 words in the Korean Language, 290,000 words were Hanja-eo. Although a phonetic Korean alphabet, now known as Chosŏn'gŭl or Hangul, had been created by Sejong the Great, it did not come into widespread official use until the late 19th and early 20th century. Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing Hanja to be literate in Korean, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most documents were written in Literary Chinese using Hanja as its primary script. Today, a good working knowledge of Chinese characters is still important for anyone who wishes to study older texts , or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities. Learning a certain number of Hanja is very helpful for understanding the etymology of Sino-Korean words and for enlarging one's Korean vocabulary. Today, Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in Hangul and even words of Chinese origin— Hanja-eo —are written with the Hangul alphabet most of the time, with the corresponding Chinese character often written next to it to prevent confusion with other characters or words with the same phonetics."	writing system that uses Korean characters of Chinese origin	wikipedia

Revised Romanization	revised romanization	"The Revised Romanization of Korean is the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea. It was developed by the National Academy of the Korean Language from 1995 and was released to the public on 7 July 2000 by South Korea's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Proclamation No. 2000-8. The new system corrected problems in the McCune–Reischauer system, such as phenomena where different consonants and vowels became indistinguishable in the absence of special symbols. To be specific, under the McCune–Reischauer system, Korean consonants ""ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ and ㅈ"" and ""ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ and ㅊ"" became indistinguishable when the apostrophe was removed. In addition, Korean vowels ""어"" and ""오"" and ""으"" and ""우"" became indistinguishable when the breve was removed. Especially in internet use where omission of apostrophes and breves is common, this caused many Koreans as well as foreigners confusion. Hence, the revision of the Romanization of Korean was made with the belief that if the old system was left unrevised, it would continue to confuse people, both Koreans and foreigners."	the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea	wikipedia

Region	region	In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics , human impact characteristics , and the interaction of humanity and the environment . Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features. As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography. A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment . The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.	2D or 3D defined space, mainly in terrestrial and astrophysics sciences	wikipedia

Density	density	"The density , of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ , although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: ρ = m V {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}} where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases , density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity ""relative density"" or ""specific gravity"", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water. The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material. The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass."	mass per volume	wikipedia

Dialect	dialect	"The term dialect is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena: * One usage refers to a variety of a language that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers. Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely mutually intelligible, especially if close to one another on the dialect continuum. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class or ethnicity. A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particular ethnic group can be termed an ethnolect, and a geographical/regional dialect may be termed a regiolect . According to this definition, any variety of a given language can be classified as ""a dialect"", including any standardized varieties. In this case, the distinction between the ""standard language"" and the ""nonstandard"" dialects of the same language is often arbitrary and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations or prevalence and prominence. In a similar way, the definitions of the terms ""language"" and ""dialect"" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary or sociopolitical motives. The term ""dialect"" is however sometimes restricted to mean ""non-standard variety"", particularly in non-specialist settings and non-English linguistic traditions. * The other usage of the term ""dialect"", specific to colloquial settings in a few countries like Italy , France and the Philippines, carries a pejorative undertone and underlines the politically and socially subordinated status of a non-national language to the single official language. In other words, it does not actually derive from the politically dominant language and is therefore not one of its varieties, but it is rather a separate and independently evolved language, albeit often historically cognate and/or genetically related. In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standardized language would not itself be considered a ""dialect"", as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, be it in terms of linguistic prestige, social or political status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Thus, these ""dialects"" are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same subfamily as the dominant language and may even, to a varying degree, share some mutual intelligibility with the standardized language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or speech community as the standardized language and instead may better fit various parties’ criteria for a separate language. The term ""dialect"" used this way implies a political connotation, being mostly used to refer to low-prestige languages , languages lacking institutional support, or those perceived as unsuitable for writing. The designation ""dialect"" is also used popularly to refer to the unwritten or non-codified languages of developing countries or isolated areas, where the term ""vernacular language"" would be preferred by linguists. Features that distinguish dialects from each other can be found in lexicon and grammar, as well as in pronunciation . Where the salient distinctions are only or mostly to be observed in pronunciation, the more specific term accent may be used instead of dialect. Other types of speech varieties include jargons, which are characterized by differences in lexicon; slang; patois; pidgins; and argots. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an idiolect."	geographically- or socially-determined language variety	wikipedia

Area code(s)	area code	A telephone numbering plan is a type of numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints. Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a telephone network, reachable by a system of destination code routing. Telephone numbering plans are defined in each of administrative regions of the public switched telephone network and they are also present in private telephone networks. For public number systems, geographic location plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber. Many numbering plans subdivide their territory of service into geographic regions designated by a prefix, often called an area code or city code , which is a set of digits forming the most-significant part of the dialing sequence to reach a telephone subscriber. Numbering plans may follow a variety of design strategies which have often arisen from the historical evolution of individual telephone networks and local requirements. A broad division is commonly recognized between closed numbering plans, such as found in North America, which feature fixed-length area codes and local numbers, while open numbering plans feature a variance in the length of the area code, local number, or both of a telephone number assigned to a subscriber line. The International Telecommunication Union has established a comprehensive numbering plan, designated E.164, for uniform interoperability of the networks of its member state or regional administrations. It is an open numbering plan, however, imposing a maximum length of 15 digits to telephone numbers. The standard defines a country calling code for each state or region which is prefixed to each national numbering plan telephone number for international destination routing. Private numbering plans exist in telephone networks that are privately operated in an enterprise or organizational campus. Such systems may be supported by a private branch exchange , which provides a central access point to the PSTN and also controls internal calls between telephone extensions. In contrast to numbering plans, which determine telephone numbers assigned to subscriber stations, dialing plans establish the customer dialing procedures, i.e., the sequence of digits or symbols to be dialed to reach a destination. It is the manner in which the numbering plan is used. Even in closed numbering plans, it is not always necessary to dial all digits of a number. For example, an area code may often be omitted when the destination is in the same area as the calling station.	type of numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints	wikipedia

ISO 3166 code	code	In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form or representation, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.	method to represent information for various purposes (storage, transmission, protection against unauthorized access etc.)	wikipedia

Flower	flower	A flower , sometimes known as a bloom or blossom , is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants . The biological function of a flower is to affect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing when self pollination occurs. Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization . Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.	sexual reproductive structure found in flowering plants	wikipedia

Tree	tree	In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world. A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development. Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead. Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.	perennial woody plant	wikipedia

Bird	bird	"Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves , characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or ""perching"" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. Birds are a group of feathered theropod dinosaurs, and constitute the only living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans which first appeared about 160 million years ago in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs. Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous or, rarely, polyandrous . Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry."	class of tetrapods	wikipedia
