Surface pressure	surface pressure	"Atmospheric pressure , also known as barometric pressure , is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325 Pa , which is equivalent to 760 mm Hg, 29.9212 inches Hg, or 14.696 psi. The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth, that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm. In most circumstances, atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point. As elevation increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation. Pressure measures force per unit area, with SI units of Pascals . On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimetre , measured from mean sea level to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a mass of about 1.03 kilogram and exerts a force or ""weight"" of about 10.1 newtons, resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm2 or 101 kN/m2 . A column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 in2 would have a weight of about 14.7 lbf, resulting in a pressure of 14.7 lbf/in2."	pressure	wikipedia

Composition by volume	volume	Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i. e., the amount of fluid that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. One-dimensional figures and two-dimensional shapes are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space. The volume of a solid can be determined by fluid displacement. Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas. The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances. However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not additive. In differential geometry , volume is expressed by means of the volume form, and is an important global Riemannian invariant. In thermodynamics , volume is a fundamental parameter, and is a conjugate variable to pressure.	quantity of three-dimensional space	wikipedia
