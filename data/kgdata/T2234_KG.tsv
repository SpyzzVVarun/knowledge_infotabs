Communities served	community	"A community is a social unit with commonality such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, ""community"" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. The English-language word ""community"" derives from the Old French comuneté , which comes from the Latin communitas ""community"", ""public spirit"" . Human communities may share intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness."	group of interacting living organisms sharing a populated environment; a social unit of human organisms who share common values	wikipedia

Length	length	Length is a measure of distance. In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units system the base unit for length is the metre. Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in. Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width , breadth or depth. Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object. Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions and volume is a measure of three dimensions .	measured dimension of an object in a physical space	wikipedia

Frequency	frequency	Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency , which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. Frequency is measured in units of hertz which is equal to one occurrence of a repeating event per second. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example: if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute , its period, T , — the time interval between beats—is half a second . Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio signals , radio waves, and light.	inverse of the period duration	wikipedia

Weekend frequency	weekend	"The workweek and weekend are the complementary parts of the week devoted to labor and rest, respectively. The legal working week , or workweek , is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labor. In most of the world, the workweek is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday, but other divisions exist: for example, many countries observe a Sunday to Thursday or even Monday to Thursday working week. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow this pattern, such as places of education. Sometimes the term ""weekend"" is expanded to include the time after work hours on the last workday of the week; e.g. Friday evening is often referred to as the start of the weekend. The weekend has had varying definitions, such as commencing after 5 pm on Friday evening and lasting until 6 pm on Sunday night. In some Christian traditions, Sunday is the ""day of rest and worship"". The Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday–Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries have historically instituted a Thursday–Friday weekend. Today, many of these countries have shifted from Thursday–Friday to Friday–Saturday, or mostly to Saturday–Sunday. The Christian Sabbath is just one day each week, but the preceding day came to be taken as a holiday as well in the 20th century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, associated with increases in levels of GDP per capita. The present-day concept of the ""weekend"" first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early 19th century. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929. Some countries have adopted a one-day weekend, i.e. either Sunday only , Friday only , or Saturday only . However, most countries have adopted a two-day weekend, whose days differ according to religious tradition, i.e. either Friday and Saturday, or Saturday and Sunday, or Friday and Sunday , with the previous evening post-work often considered part of the weekend. Proposals continue to be put forward to reduce the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits."	parts of the week devoted to labor and rest, respectively	wikipedia
