Birth name	birth name	The birth name is the name of the person given upon their birth. The term may be applied to the surname, the given name or to the entire name. Where births are required to be officially registered, the entire name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become the person's legal name. The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairsâ€”either throughout life, or until marriage. Some possible changes concern middle names, diminutive forms, changes relating to parental status , and changes related to gender transition. Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only, rather than for life.	last name acquired at birth or (in some jurisdictions) at least otherwise than by marriage	wikipedia

Died	died	Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging, physiological or organ failure, predation, poisoning, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, asphyxia, drowning, severe burns, drug intoxication, starvation, dehydration, electrocution, intense heat or cold, radiation toxicity, warfare attacks such as bombings, as well as explosions and accidents or major trauma resulting in fatal injury. The remains of a living organism begin to decompose shortly after death. It is an inevitable process eventually occurring in all living organisms. As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day. Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds. Other concerns include fear of death, necrophobia, anxiety, sorrow, grief, emotional pain, depression, sympathy, compassion, solitude, or saudade. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also hold the idea of judgement and reward for good deeds or punishment for sin.	permanent cessation of vital functions	wikipedia

Known for	know	"Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts , skills , or objects . Knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many difference sources, including but not limited to experience, education, reason, memory, scientific inquiry, exploration, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit or explicit ; formal or informal; systematic or particular. The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus , leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief"". The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century."	experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning; theoretical or practical understanding of a subject	wikipedia
