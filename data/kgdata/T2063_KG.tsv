Pronunciation	pronunciation	Pronunciation is the way in which a word or a language is spoken. This may refer to generally agreed-upon sequences of sounds used in speaking a given word or language in a specific dialect , or simply the way a particular individual speaks a word or language. A word can be spoken in different ways by various individuals or groups, depending on many factors, such as: the duration of the cultural exposure of their childhood, the location of their current residence, speech or voice disorders, their ethnic group, their social class, or their education.	way a word or a language is spoken, or the manner in which someone utters a word	wikipedia

Mass number	mass number	The mass number ), also called atomic mass number or nucleon number , is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. It is approximately equal to the atomic mass of the atom expressed in atomic mass units. Since protons and neutrons are both baryons, the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion. The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element. Hence, the difference between the mass number and the atomic number Z gives the number of neutrons in a given nucleus: N = A − Z. The mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of carbon is carbon-12, or 12 C , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number: 12 6C .	number of heavy particles in the atomic nucleus	wikipedia

Atomic number (Z)	atomic number	The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons. The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons N gives the mass number A of an atom. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass units , is within 1% of the whole number A. Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers, and hence different mass numbers, are known as isotopes. A little more than three- quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century. The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Z ahl meaning number , which, before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word Atom z ahl come into common use in this context.	number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom	wikipedia

Element category	element category	"There are currently 118 known chemical elements exhibiting many different physical and chemical properties. Amongst this diversity, scientists have found it useful to use names for various sets of elements, that illustrate similar properties, or their trends of properties. Many of these sets are formally recognized by the standards body IUPAC. The following collective names are recommended by IUPAC: * Alkali metals – The metals of group 1: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr. * Alkaline earth metals – The metals of group 2: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra. * Pnictogens – The elements of group 15: N, P, As, Sb, Bi. * Chalcogens – The elements of group 16: O, S, Se, Te, Po. * Halogens – The elements of group 17: F, Cl, Br, I, At. * Noble gases – The elements of group 18: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn. * Lanthanides – Elements 57–71: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu. * Actinides – Elements 89–103: Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No, Lr. * Rare-earth metals – Sc, Y, plus the lanthanoids. * Transition elements – Elements in groups 3 to 11 or 3 to 12. Another common classification is by degree of metallic – metalloidal – nonmetallic behaviour and characteristics. There is no general agreement on the name to use for these sets: in this English Wikipedia, the name used is ""category"". Very often these categories are marked by a background color in the periodic table. Category names used here, without any claim to universality, are: * Alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and noble gases: Same as the IUPAC system above. * Transition elements are instead referred to as transition metals. * Lanthanoids and actinoids are instead referred to as lanthanides and actinides respectively. * Rare-earth elements, pnictogens, chalcogens, and halogens are not used as category names, but the latter three are valid as group names. * Additional element category names used: * Post-transition metals – The metals of groups 12–18: Zn, Cd, Hg, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, Bi, Po. The period 7 elements Nh, Fl, Mc, Lv, and Ts are additionally predicted to be post-transition metals, and Og may be one as well. * Metalloids – Elements with properties intermediate between metals and non-metals: B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, At. * Reactive nonmetals – Nonmetals that are chemically active : H, C, N, P, O, S, Se, F, Cl, Br, I * Superactinides – Hypothetical series of elements 121 to 157, which includes a predicted ""g-block"" of the periodic table. Many other names for sets of elements are in common use, and yet others have been used throughout history. These sets usually do not aim to cover the whole periodic table . Some examples: * Precious metals – Variously-defined group of non-radioactive metals of high economical value. * Coinage metals – Various metals used to mint coins, primarily the group 11 elements Cu, Ag, and Au. * Platinum group – Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt. * Noble metal – Variously-defined group of metals that are generally resistant to corrosion. Usually includes Ag, Au, and the platinum-group metals. * Heavy metals – Variously-defined group of metals, on the base of their density, atomic number, or toxicity. * Native metals – Metals that occur pure in nature, including the noble metals and others such as Sn and Pb. * Earth metal – Old historic term, usually referred to the metals of groups 3 and 13, although sometimes others such as beryllium and chromium are included as well. * Transuranium elements – Elements with atomic number greater than 92. * Transactinide elements – Elements after the actinides . * Transplutonium elements – Elements with atomic number greater than 94. * Minor actinides – Actinides found in significant quantities in nuclear fuel, other than U and Pu: Np, Am, Cm. * Heavy atom – term used in computational chemistry to refer to any element other than hydrogen and helium."	group of chemical elements	wikipedia

Electron configuration	electron configuration	In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6, using the notation explained below. Electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by all other orbitals. Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, for systems with only one electron, a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration and in certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon. Knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements. This is also useful for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together. In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.

Electrons per shell	electron shell	"In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus. The closest shell to the nucleus is called the ""1 shell"" , followed by the ""2 shell"" , then the ""3 shell"" , and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation . Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 and so on. The general formula is that the n th shell can in principle hold up to 2 electrons. For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration. Each shell consists of one or more subshells , and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals."	principal energy levels in atomic physics	wikipedia

Boiling point	boiling point	The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor. The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 100 °C at sea level, but at 93.4 °C at 1,905 metres altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures. The normal boiling point of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, one atmosphere. At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar. The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure . Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.	temperature at which a substance changes from solid into vapor	wikipedia

Density (near r.t.)	density	"The density , of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ , although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: ρ = m V {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}} where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases , density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity ""relative density"" or ""specific gravity"", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water. The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material. The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass."	mass per volume	wikipedia

Heat of vaporization	heat of vaporization	The enthalpy of vaporization , also known as the heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation , is the amount of energy that must be added to a liquid substance, to transform a quantity of that substance into a gas. The enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the pressure at which that transformation takes place. The enthalpy of vaporization is often quoted for the normal boiling temperature of the substance; although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298 K, that correction is often smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value. The heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent, though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperature T r {\displaystyle T{r}} ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \ll 1} . The heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature . Above the critical temperature, the liquid and vapor phases are indistinguishable, and the substance is called a supercritical fluid.	energy to convert a liquid substance to a gas; a function of pressure	wikipedia

Oxidation states	oxidation states	"The oxidation state , sometimes referred to as oxidation number , describes the degree of oxidation of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state, which may be positive, negative or zero, is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic, with no covalent component. This is never exactly true for real bonds. The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost, regardless of whether oxygen was involved. Oxidation states are typically represented by integers which may be positive, zero, or negative. In some cases, the average oxidation state of an element is a fraction, such as 8/3 for iron in magnetite . The highest known oxidation state is reported to be +9 in the tetroxoiridium cation . It is predicted that even a +10 oxidation state may be achievable by platinum in the tetroxoplatinum cation . The lowest oxidation state is −5, as for boron in Al3BC. The increase in oxidation state of an atom, through a chemical reaction, is known as an oxidation; a decrease in oxidation state is known as a reduction. Such reactions involve the formal transfer of electrons: a net gain in electrons being a reduction, and a net loss of electrons being an oxidation. For pure elements, the oxidation state is zero. The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property. This is particularly true of high oxidation states, where the ionization energy required to produce a multiply positive ion is far greater than the energies available in chemical reactions. Additionally, oxidation states of atoms in a given compound may vary depending on the choice of electronegativity scale used in their calculation. Thus, the oxidation state of an atom in a compound is purely a formalism. It is nevertheless important in understanding the nomenclature conventions of inorganic compounds. Also, a number of observations pertaining to chemical reactions may be explained at a basic level in terms of oxidation states. In inorganic nomenclature, the oxidation state is represented by a Roman numeral placed after the element name inside a parenthesis or as a superscript after the element symbol."	number that describes degree of oxidation of an atom in a chemical compound; the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were fully ionic	wikipedia

Electronegativity	electronegativity	"Electronegativity , symbol χ , is a concept that describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons towards itself. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons towards itself. On the most basic level, electronegativity is determined by factors like the nuclear charge and the number/location of other electrons present in the atomic shells . The opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity : a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons. The term ""electronegativity"" was introduced by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1811, though the concept was known even before that and was studied by many chemists including Avogadro. In spite of its long history, an accurate scale of electronegativity was not developed until 1932, when Linus Pauling proposed an electronegativity scale, which depends on bond energies, as a development of valence bond theory. It has been shown to correlate with a number of other chemical properties. Electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties. Several methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity, all methods show the same periodic trends between elements. The most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, commonly referred to as the Pauling scale , on a relative scale running from 0.79 to 3.98 . When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units. As it is usually calculated, electronegativity is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule. Properties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity. It is to be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment, but it is usually considered to be a transferable property, that is to say that similar values will be valid in a variety of situations. Caesium is the least electronegative element in the periodic table , while fluorine is most electronegative . Francium and caesium were originally both assigned 0.7; caesium's value was later refined to 0.79, but no experimental data allows a similar refinement for francium. However, francium's ionization energy is known to be slightly higher than caesium's, in accordance with the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital, and this in turn implies that francium is in fact more electronegative than caesium."	chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself	wikipedia

Ionization energies	ionization energies	In physics and chemistry, ionization energy or ionisation energy , denoted E i, is the minimum amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence electron, of an isolated neutral gaseous atom or molecule. It is quantitatively expressed as X + energy → X+ + e− where X is any atom or molecule capable of ionization, X+ is that atom or molecule with an electron removed, and e− is the removed electron. This is generally an endothermic process. Generally, the closer the outermost electrons to the nucleus of the atom, the higher the atom's or element's ionization energy. The sciences of physics and chemistry use different measures of ionization energy. In physics, the unit is the amount of energy required to remove a single electron from a single atom or molecule, expressed as electronvolts. In chemistry, the unit is the amount of energy required for all of the atoms in a mole of substance to lose one electron each: molar ionization energy or enthalpy, expressed as kilojoules per mole or kilocalories per mole . Comparison of E i of elements in the periodic table reveals two periodic trends: 1. E i generally increases as one moves from left to right within a given period . 2. E i generally decreases as one moves from top to bottom in a given group . The latter trend results from the outer electron shell being progressively farther from the nucleus, with the addition of one inner shell per row as one moves down the column. The n th ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the species having a charge of . For example, the first three ionization energies are defined as follows: 1st ionization energy X → X+ \+ e− 2nd ionization energy X+ → X2+ \+ e− 3rd ionization energy X2+ → X3+ \+ e− The term ionization potential is an older name for ionization energy, because the oldest method of measuring ionization energy was based on ionizing a sample and accelerating the electron removed using an electrostatic potential. However this term is now considered obsolete. Some factors affecting the ionization energy include: 1. Nuclear charge: if the nuclear charge is greater, the electrons are held more tightly by the nucleus and hence the ionization energy will be greater. 2. Number of electron shells: if the size of the atom is greater due to the presence of more shells, the electrons are held less tightly by the nucleus and the ionization energy will be less. 3. Effective nuclear charge : if the magnitude of electron shielding and penetration are greater, the electrons are held less tightly by the nucleus, the Z eff of the electron and the ionization energy are smaller. 4. Type of orbital ionized: an atom having a more stable electronic configuration has less tendency to lose electrons and consequently has high ionization energy. 5. Orbital occupancy of the orbital: if the orbital is half or completely filled, then it is harder to remove electrons.	minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom or molecule in the gaseous state	wikipedia

Covalent radius	covalent radius	The covalent radius , r cov, is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond. It is usually measured either in picometres or angstroms , with 1 Å = 100 pm. In principle, the sum of the two covalent radii should equal the covalent bond length between two atoms, R = r + r . Moreover, different radii can be introduced for single, double and triple bonds , in a purely operational sense. These relationships are certainly not exact because the size of an atom is not constant but depends on its chemical environment. For heteroatomic A–B bonds, ionic terms may enter. Often the polar covalent bonds are shorter than would be expected on the basis of the sum of covalent radii. Tabulated values of covalent radii are either average or idealized values, which nevertheless show a certain transferability between different situations, which makes them useful. The bond lengths R are measured by X-ray diffraction . Rotational spectroscopy can also give extremely accurate values of bond lengths. For homonuclear A–A bonds, Linus Pauling took the covalent radius to be half the single-bond length in the element, e.g. R = 74.14 pm so r cov = 37.07 pm: in practice, it is usual to obtain an average value from a variety of covalent compounds, although the difference is usually small. Sanderson has published a recent set of non-polar covalent radii for the main-group elements, but the availability of large collections of bond lengths, which are more transferable, from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database has rendered covalent radii obsolete in many situations.	measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond	wikipedia

Van der Waals radius	radius	In classical geometry, a radius of a circle or sphere is any of the line segments from its center to its perimeter, and in more modern usage, it is also their length. The name comes from the Latin radius , meaning ray but also the spoke of a chariot wheel. The plural of radius can be either radii or the conventional English plural radiuses. The typical abbreviation and mathematical variable name for radius is r. By extension, the diameter d is defined as twice the radius: d ≐ 2 r ⇒ r = d 2 . {\displaystyle d\doteq 2r\quad \Rightarrow \quad r={\frac {d}{2}}.} If an object does not have a center, the term may refer to its circumradius , the radius of its circumscribed circle or circumscribed sphere. In either case, the radius may be more than half the diameter, which is usually defined as the maximum distance between any two points of the figure. The inradius of a geometric figure is usually the radius of the largest circle or sphere contained in it. The inner radius of a ring, tube or other hollow object is the radius of its cavity. For regular polygons, the radius is the same as its circumradius. The inradius of a regular polygon is also called apothem. In graph theory, the radius of a graph is the minimum over all vertices u of the maximum distance from u to any other vertex of the graph. The radius of the circle with perimeter C is r = C 2 π . {\displaystyle r={\frac {C}{2\pi }}.}	segment in a circle or sphere from its center to its perimeter or surface and its length	wikipedia

Natural occurrence	natural	"Nature , in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. ""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura , or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"". In ancient philosophy, Natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis , which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers , and has steadily gained currency ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history . However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin. Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural."	Natural, physical, or material world and its phenomena	wikipedia
Natural occurrence	occurrence	"The type–token distinction is the difference between naming a class of objects and naming the individual instances of that class. Since each type may be represented by multiple tokens, there are generally more tokens than types of an object. For example, the sentence ""A rose is a rose is a rose"" contains three word types, ""a"", ""rose"", and ""is""; and eight word tokens of those types, ""a"", ""rose"", ""is"", ""a"", ""rose"", ""is"", ""a"", ""rose"". The distinction is important in disciplines such as logic, linguistics, metalogic, typography, and computer programming."	distinction that separates a concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept	wikipedia

Thermal conductivity	thermal conductivity	The thermal conductivity of a material is a measure of its ability to conduct heat. It is commonly denoted by k {\displaystyle k} , λ {\displaystyle \lambda } , or κ {\displaystyle \kappa } . Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate in materials of low thermal conductivity than in materials of high thermal conductivity. For instance, metals typically have high thermal conductivity and are very efficient at conducting heat, while the opposite is true for insulating materials like Styrofoam. Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications, and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity. The defining equation for thermal conductivity is q = − k ∇ T {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =-k\nabla T} , where q {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} } is the heat flux, k {\displaystyle k} is the thermal conductivity, and ∇ T {\displaystyle \nabla T} is the temperature gradient. This is known as Fourier's Law for heat conduction. Although commonly expressed as a scalar, the most general form of thermal conductivity is a second-rank tensor. However, the tensorial description only becomes necessary in materials which are anisotropic.	capacity of a material to conduct heat	wikipedia

CAS Number	cas number	A CAS Registry Number , also referred to as CASRN or CAS Number , is a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature , including organic and inorganic compounds, minerals, isotopes, alloys and nonstructurable materials . CASRNs are generally serial numbers , so they do not contain any information about the structures themselves the way SMILES and InChI strings do. The registry maintained by CAS is an authoritative collection of disclosed chemical substance information. It currently identifies more than 158 million unique organic and inorganic substances and 67 million protein and DNA sequences, plus additional information about each substance. It is updated with around 15,000 additional new substances daily.	chemical identifier	wikipedia
