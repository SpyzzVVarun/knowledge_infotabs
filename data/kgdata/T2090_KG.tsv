Ancestor arts	ancestor	"An ancestor , also known as a forefather , fore-elder or a forebear , is a parent or the parent of an antecedent . Ancestor is ""any person from whom one is descended. In law the person from whom an estate has been inherited."" Two individuals have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other or if they share a common ancestor. In evolutionary theory, species which share an evolutionary ancestor are said to be of common descent. However, this concept of ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of horizontal gene transfer. Some research suggests that the average person has twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. This might have been due to the past prevalence of polygynous relations and female hypergamy. Assuming that all of an individual's ancestors are otherwise unrelated to each other, that individual has 2 n ancestors in the n th generation before him and a total of 2 g +1 âˆ’ 2 ancestors in the g generations before him. In practice, however, it is clear that most ancestors of humans are multiply related . Consider n = 40: the human species is more than 40 generations old, yet the number 240, approximately 1012 or one trillion, dwarfs the number of humans who have ever lived. Some cultures confer reverence to ancestors, both living and dead; in contrast, some more youth-oriented cultural contexts display less veneration of elders. In other cultural contexts, some people seek providence from their deceased ancestors; this practice is sometimes known as ancestor worship or, more accurately, ancestor veneration."	person from whom another person is descended (for the first person use: Q2329919)	wikipedia
Ancestor arts	art	Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts , expressing the author's imaginative, conceptual ideas, or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. Other activities related to the production of works of art include the criticism of art, and the study of the history of art. The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture and architecture. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts. Though there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation. The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.	expressive work intended to be appreciated for its beauty or emotional power; or the process of creating such a work	wikipedia
