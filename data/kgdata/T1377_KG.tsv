Some types of result are as follows: * in general, the outcome of any kind of research, action or phenomenon * in games or wars, the result includes the identity of the victorious party and possibly the effects on the environment * in mathematics, the final value of a calculation , function or statistical expression, or the final statement of a theorem that has been proven * in statistics, any information analyzed, extracted or interpolated from polls, tests or logs * in computer sciences, the return value of a function, state of a system or list of records matching a query . The result type is the data type of the data returned by a function. * in science, the outcome of an experiment * in forensics and justice, the proof of guilt or innocence of a suspect after evaluating evidence in a criminal investigation * in economics and accounting, the profit or loss at the end of a fiscal period. * in democracy,	final consequence of a sequence of actions or events	wikipedia

Causalities and losses	causality	"Causality is influence by which one event, process or state contributes to the production of another event, process or state where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause. In general, a process has many causes, which are also said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past. An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its future. Some writers have held that causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space. Causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses, so basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than as something to be explained by others more basic. The concept is like those of agency and efficacy. For this reason, a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it. Accordingly, causality is implicit in the logic and structure of ordinary language. In English studies of Aristotelian philosophy, the word ""cause"" is used as a specialized technical term, the translation of Aristotle's term αἰτία, by which Aristotle meant ""explanation"" or ""answer to a 'why' question"". Aristotle categorized the four types of answers as material, formal, efficient, and final ""causes"". In this case, the ""cause"" is the explanans for the explanandum, and failure to recognize that different kinds of ""cause"" are being considered can lead to futile debate. Of Aristotle's four explanatory modes, the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the ""efficient"" one. David Hume, as part of his opposition to rationalism, argued that pure reason alone cannot prove the reality of efficient causality; instead, he appealed to custom and mental habit, observing that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. The topic of causality remains a staple in contemporary philosophy."	efficacy that connects a causing process with a resulting process or state, where the first process is partly accountable for the second and the second is dependent on the first	wikipedia
