Manufacturer	manufacturer	Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation, and is the essence of secondary industry. The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part. Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead. The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design. Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, General Dynamics, Boeing, Pfizer Precision Castparts And FCA. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group, Siemens, FCA and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Yamaha, Panasonic, LG, Samsung and Tata Motors.	industrial activity producing goods for sale using labor and machines	wikipedia

Head material	head	A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively. Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head.	part of an organism	wikipedia

Turbocharger	turbocharger	"A turbocharger , colloquially known as a turbo , is a turbine-driven, forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra compressed air into the combustion chamber. This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output is due to the fact that the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure alone. Turbochargers were originally known as turbosuperchargers when all forced induction devices were classified as superchargers. Today, the term ""supercharger"" is typically applied only to mechanically driven forced induction devices. The key difference between a turbocharger and a conventional supercharger is that a supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine, often through a belt connected to the crankshaft, whereas a turbocharger is powered by a turbine driven by the engine's exhaust gas. Compared with a mechanically driven supercharger, turbochargers tend to be more efficient, but less responsive. Twincharger refers to an engine with both a supercharger and a turbocharger. Manufacturers commonly use turbochargers in truck, car, train, aircraft, and construction-equipment engines. They are most often used with Otto cycle and Diesel cycle internal combustion engines."	forced induction device for internal combustion engines	wikipedia

Management	management	"Management is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term ""management"" may also refer to those people who manage an organization - individually: managers. Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization and organizational leadership. Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce Bachelor of Business Administration Master of Business Administration Master in Management and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration degree. Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management , the Doctor of Business Administration , or the PhD in Business Administration or Management. There has recently been a movement for evidence- based management. Larger organizations generally have three levels of managers, which are typically organized in a hierarchical, pyramid structure: * Senior managers, such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer or a president of an organization. They set the strategic goals of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals, and provide direction to middle management, who directly or indirectly report to them. * Middle managers - examples of these would include branch managers, regional managers, department managers and section managers, who provide direction to front-line managers. Middle managers communicate the strategic goals of senior management to the front-line managers. * Lower managers, such as supervisors and front-line team leaders, oversee the work of regular employees and provide direction on their work. In smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization."	administration of an organization, including activities to set the strategy of an organization and coordinate employees to accomplish its objectives	wikipedia

Fuel type	fuel	A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as heat energy or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy . The heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine. Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with combustion. Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. Hydrocarbons and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized. Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy or mechanical energy .	any material that stores energy that can later be extracted, in presence of a oxidizer or a catalyser, or under the effect of a tool, but which is not conserved after the reaction	wikipedia

Oil system	oil	An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is a viscous liquid at ambient temperatures and is both hydrophobic and lipophilic . Oils have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are usually flammable and surface active. Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature. The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses. Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile. They are used for food , fuel , medical purposes , lubrication , and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials. Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.	water-insoluble unctuous combustible substances that are liquid (or easily liquefiable on warming), and are soluble in ether	wikipedia

Torque output	torque	"Torque , moment , moment of force , rotational force or ""turning effect"" is the rotational equivalent of linear force. The concept originated with the studies by Archimedes of the usage of levers. Just as a linear force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object around a specific axis. Another definition of torque is the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance of the line of action of force from the axis of rotation. The symbol for torque is typically τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} , the lowercase Greek letter tau. When being referred to as moment of force, it is commonly denoted by M. In three dimensions, the torque is a pseudovector; for point particles, it is given by the cross product of the position vector and the force vector. The magnitude of torque of a rigid body depends on three quantities: the force applied, the lever arm vector connecting the point about which the torque is being measured to the point of force application, and the angle between the force and lever arm vectors. In symbols: τ = r × F {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} \,\\!} τ = ‖ r ‖ ‖ F ‖ sin ⁡ θ {\displaystyle \tau =\|\mathbf {r} \|\,\|\mathbf {F} \|\sin \theta \,\\!} where τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} is the torque vector and τ {\displaystyle \tau } is the magnitude of the torque, r is the position vector F is the force vector, × denotes the cross product, which produces a vector that is perpendicular to both r and F following the right-hand rule, θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the angle between the force vector and the lever arm vector. The SI unit for torque is N⋅m. For more on the units of torque, see Units."	tendency of a force to rotate an object	wikipedia
