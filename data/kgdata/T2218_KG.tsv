Subset of	subset	In mathematics, a set A is a subset of a set B , or equivalently B is a superset of A , if A is contained in B. That is, all elements of A are also elements of B. A and B may be equal; if they are unequal, then A is a proper subset of B. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment. A is a subset of B may also be expressed as B includes A , or A is included in B. The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.	"set A is a subset of a set B, or equivalently B is a superset of A, if A is ""contained"" inside B, that is, all elements of A are also elements of B. A and B may coincide"	wikipedia

Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed. The historical concept and definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word ""gay"" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term ""sexual orientation"" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component and/or a behavioural component . Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or identity. See homosexuality and bisexuality for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual people. The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2013 Global Attitudes Survey found that there is “greater acceptance in more secular and affluent countries,” with ""publics in 39 countries broad acceptance of homosexuality in North America, the European Union, and much of Latin America, but equally widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and in Russia. Opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality is divided in Israel, Poland and Bolivia.” As of 2013, Americans are divided – a majority believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 33 percent disagree."
