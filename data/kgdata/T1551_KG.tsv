Citizenship	citizenship	Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law of a sovereign state as a member of or belonging to the state. Each state is free to determine the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. The status of citizenship does not of itself create any rights in a person not bestowed or recognised by the state. The idea of citizenship has been defined as the capacity of individuals to defend their rights in front of the governmental authority. In general, the main rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country and to work there. Some countries permit its citizens to have multiple citizenships, while others insist on exclusive allegiance. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless, while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander. Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation . In some countries, e.g. the United States, the United Kingdom, nationality and citizenship can have different meanings.	denotes the link between a person and a state or an association of states.	wikipedia

Known for	know	"Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts , skills , or objects . Knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many difference sources, including but not limited to experience, education, reason, memory, scientific inquiry, exploration, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit or explicit ; formal or informal; systematic or particular. The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus , leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief"". The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century."	experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning; theoretical or practical understanding of a subject	wikipedia
