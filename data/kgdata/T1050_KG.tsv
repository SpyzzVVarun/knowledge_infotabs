Alternative names	name	"A name is a term used for identification. They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its referent. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called "" common names "" or "" general names "". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name. Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another. For example, the French sometimes refer to Aristotle as ""le Stagirite"" from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to Shakespeare as ""The Bard"", recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language."	word or term used for identification; see also proper noun (Q147276) and personal name (Q1071027)	wikipedia

Main ingredients	ingredient	An ingredient is a substance that forms part of a mixture . For example, in cooking, recipes specify which ingredients are used to prepare a specific dish. Many commercial products contain secret ingredients that are purported to make them better than competing products. In the pharmaceutical industry, an active ingredient is that part of a formulation that yields the effect expected by the customer. National laws usually require prepared food products to display a list of ingredients, and specifically require that certain additives be listed. In most developed countries, the law requires that ingredients be listed according to their relative weight in the product. If an ingredient itself consists of more than one ingredient , then that ingredient is listed by what percentage of the total product it occupies, with its own ingredients displayed next to it in brackets. The term constituent is often chosen when referring to the substances that constitute the tissue of living beings such as plants and people, because the word ingredient in many minds connotes a sense of human agency , whereas the natural products present in living beings were not added by any human agency but rather occurred naturally . Thus all ingredients are constituents, but not all constituents are ingredients.	substance used in the preparation of food	wikipedia
