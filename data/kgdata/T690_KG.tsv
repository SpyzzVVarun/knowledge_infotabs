Nationality	nationality	Nationality is a legal relationship between an individual person and a state. Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state. What these rights and duties are varies from state to state. This relationship generally enables intervention by a State to provide help and protection to its nationals when they are harmed by other States. By custom and international conventions, it is the right of each state to determine who its nationals are. Such determinations are part of nationality law. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by public international lawâ€”for example, by treaties on statelessness and the European Convention on Nationality. Nationality differs technically and legally from citizenship, which is a different legal relationship between a person and a country. The noun national can include both citizens and non-citizens. The most common distinguishing feature of citizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the political life of the state, such as by voting or standing for election. However, in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the state, and full citizens are always nationals of the state. In older texts the word nationality , rather than ethnicity , is often used to refer to an ethnic group . This older meaning of nationality is not defined by political borders or passport ownership and includes nations that lack an independent state . Individuals may also be considered nationals of groups with autonomous status that have ceded some power to a larger government.	relationship between an individual human and a state	wikipedia

Alma mater	alma mater	"Alma mater almae matres ) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university, school, or college that one formerly attended. In US usage, it can also mean the school from which one graduated. The phrase is variously translated as ""nourishing mother"", ""nursing mother"", or ""fostering mother"", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students. Before its current usage, alma mater was an honorific title for various Latin mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele, and later in Catholicism for the Virgin Mary. It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum , which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus , a term used for a university graduate that literally means a ""nursling"" or ""one who is nourished"". *: literal translation"	school or university that a person has attended	wikipedia

Awards	awards	An award , sometimes called a distinction , is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field. When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration. An award may be described by three aspects: 1) who is given 2) what 3) by whom, all varying according to purpose. The recipient is often a single person or else a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country. The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal , badge, ribbon or pin. It can also be a token object such as prize, trophy or commemorative plaque. The award may also be or be accompanied by a title, certificate or diploma, as well as an object of direct value such as money or a scholarship. Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way. An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority , or else a private organisation or individual. The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards. For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize. Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests. The Stanley Cup is a modern example. In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces.. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient. Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory. There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools. A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations.	something given to a person or a group of people to recognize their merit or excellence	wikipedia

Institutions	institutions	"Institutions , according to Samuel P. Huntington, are ""stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior"". Further, institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community; moreover, institutions are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior. According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior. Instead, Hodgson states that institutions are ""integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions"". The term ""institution"" commonly applies to both informal institutions such as customs, or behavior patterns important to a society, and to particular formal institutions created by entities such as the government and public services. Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family that are broad enough to encompass other institutions. Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology . Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement."	structure or mechanism of social order and cooperation governing the behaviour of a set of individuals within a given community	wikipedia

Doctoral advisor	doctoral advisor	"A doctoral advisor is a member of a university faculty whose role is to guide graduate students who are candidates for a doctorate, helping them select coursework, as well as shaping, refining and directing the students' choice of sub-discipline in which they will be examined or on which they will write a dissertation. Students generally choose advisors based on their areas of interest within their discipline, their desire to work closely with particular graduate faculty, and the willingness and availability of those faculty to work with them. In some countries, the student's advisor serves as the chair of the doctoral examination or dissertation committees. In some cases, though, the person who serves those roles may be different from the faculty member who has most closely advised the student. For instance, in the Dutch academic system, only full professors and associate professors may chair doctoral examinations, so students who have been advised by lower-ranked faculty members will have a full or associate professor as their official advisor and their actual advisor as co-promoter. In other countries, such as Spain, the doctoral advisor has the role of a mentor, but is not allowed to form part of the examination committee. This is a body of five experts independently selected by the rectorate among ten candidates proposed by the university's department. An academic genealogy may be traced based on student's doctoral advisors, going up and down the lines of academic ""descent"" in a manner analogous to a traditional genealogy."
