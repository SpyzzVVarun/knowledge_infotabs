Reign	reign	"A reign is the period of a person's or dynasty's occupation of the office of monarch of a nation , of a people or of a spiritual community . In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign's reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed. In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch's tenure in office . The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation ""r."" after a sovereign's name, such as the following: George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India"	period in which a sovereign rules	wikipedia
