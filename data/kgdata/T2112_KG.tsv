Subset of	subset	In mathematics, a set A is a subset of a set B , or equivalently B is a superset of A , if A is contained in B. That is, all elements of A are also elements of B. A and B may be equal; if they are unequal, then A is a proper subset of B. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment. A is a subset of B may also be expressed as B includes A , or A is included in B. The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.	"set A is a subset of a set B, or equivalently B is a superset of A, if A is ""contained"" inside B, that is, all elements of A are also elements of B. A and B may coincide"	wikipedia
