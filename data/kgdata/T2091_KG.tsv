Livery	livery	"A livery is a uniform, insignia or symbol adorning; in a non-military context, a person, an object or a vehicle that denotes a relationship between the wearer of the livery and an individual or corporate body. Often, elements of the heraldry relating to the individual or corporate body feature in the livery. Alternatively, some kind of a personal emblem or badge, or a distinctive colour, is featured. The word itself derives from the French livrée , meaning dispensed, handed over. Most often it would indicate that the wearer of the livery was a servant, dependant, follower or friend of the owner of the livery, or, in the case of objects, that the object belonged to them. In the late medieval phenomenon of bastard feudalism, livery badges worn by the ""retainers"" of great lords, sometimes in effect private armies, became a great political concern in England."	uniforms worn by servants or other classes of people	wikipedia

Communities served	community	"A community is a social unit with commonality such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity.

Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, ""community"" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. The English-language word ""community"" derives from the Old French comuneté , which comes from the Latin communitas ""community"", ""public spirit"" .

Frequency	frequency	Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency , which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. Frequency is measured in units of hertz which is equal to one occurrence of a repeating event per second. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example: if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute , its period, T , — the time interval between beats—is half a second . Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio signals , radio waves, and light.	inverse of the period duration	wikipedia
