Hangul	hangul	"The Korean alphabet , known as Hangul in South Korea and Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea, was logically and scientifically invented by King Sejong the Great in 1443 to write the Korean language. All basic letters mimic their articulator's shape and phonetic features when pronouncing them, making Hangul the most faithful contemporary featural writing system. In the Hangul orthography, it consists of 24 basic letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters . Originally, it consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters. 4 letters became obsolete: 1 vowel letter and 3 consonant letters . In practice, there are 19 complex letters with 5 tense consonants and 11 complex vowels combining the basic letters. The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic letters arranged in two dimensions. For example, the Korean word for ""honeybee"" is written 꿀벌, not ㄲㅜㄹㅂㅓㄹ. As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an ""alphabetic syllabary."" As in traditional Chinese writing, Korean texts were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left, and are occasionally still written this way for stylistic purposes. Today, it is typically written from left to right with spaces between words and western-style punctuation. It is the official writing system of Korea, including both North and South Korea. It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau, Indonesia. The Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin ."	native alphabet of the Korean language	wikipedia

Hanja	hanja	"Hanja nt͈ɕa]) is the Korean name for an old writing system consisting mainly of Traditional Chinese characters in China) that was incorporated and used since the Gojoseon period . More specifically, it refers to the Traditional Chinese characters incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. Hanja-eo refers to words that can be written with Hanja, and hanmun refers to Classical Chinese writing. Although ""Hanja"" is sometimes also used loosely to encompass these concepts. Because Hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to traditional Chinese and kyūjitai characters, though the stroke orders for some characters are slightly different. For example, the characters 教 and 研 are written as 敎 and 硏. Only a small number of Hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding Hanja characters. According to the Standard Korean Language Dictionary , published by the National Institute of Korean Language , out of the approximately 510,000 words in the Korean Language, 290,000 words were Hanja-eo. Although a phonetic Korean alphabet, now known as Chosŏn'gŭl or Hangul, had been created by Sejong the Great, it did not come into widespread official use until the late 19th and early 20th century. Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing Hanja to be literate in Korean, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most documents were written in Literary Chinese using Hanja as its primary script. Today, a good working knowledge of Chinese characters is still important for anyone who wishes to study older texts , or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities. Learning a certain number of Hanja is very helpful for understanding the etymology of Sino-Korean words and for enlarging one's Korean vocabulary. Today, Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in Hangul and even words of Chinese origin— Hanja-eo —are written with the Hangul alphabet most of the time, with the corresponding Chinese character often written next to it to prevent confusion with other characters or words with the same phonetics."	writing system that uses Korean characters of Chinese origin	wikipedia

Revised Romanization	revised romanization	"The Revised Romanization of Korean is the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea. It was developed by the National Academy of the Korean Language from 1995 and was released to the public on 7 July 2000 by South Korea's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Proclamation No. 2000-8. The new system corrected problems in the McCune–Reischauer system, such as phenomena where different consonants and vowels became indistinguishable in the absence of special symbols. To be specific, under the McCune–Reischauer system, Korean consonants ""ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ and ㅈ"" and ""ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ and ㅊ"" became indistinguishable when the apostrophe was removed. In addition, Korean vowels ""어"" and ""오"" and ""으"" and ""우"" became indistinguishable when the breve was removed. Especially in internet use where omission of apostrophes and breves is common, this caused many Koreans as well as foreigners confusion. Hence, the revision of the Romanization of Korean was made with the belief that if the old system was left unrevised, it would continue to confuse people, both Koreans and foreigners."	the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea	wikipedia

Kennedy appointed Reischauer as the United States Ambassador to Japan, where he served . Reischauer founded the Japan Institute at Harvard University in 1973 and was its founding director.

Region	region	In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics , human impact characteristics , and the interaction of humanity and the environment . Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features. As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography. A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment . The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.	2D or 3D defined space, mainly in terrestrial and astrophysics sciences	wikipedia
