Died	died	Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging, physiological or organ failure, predation, poisoning, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, asphyxia, drowning, severe burns, drug intoxication, starvation, dehydration, electrocution, intense heat or cold, radiation toxicity, warfare attacks such as bombings, as well as explosions and accidents or major trauma resulting in fatal injury. The remains of a living organism begin to decompose shortly after death. It is an inevitable process eventually occurring in all living organisms. As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day. Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds. Other concerns include fear of death, necrophobia, anxiety, sorrow, grief, emotional pain, depression, sympathy, compassion, solitude, or saudade. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also hold the idea of judgement and reward for good deeds or punishment for sin.	permanent cessation of vital functions	wikipedia

Nationality	nationality	Nationality is a legal relationship between an individual person and a state. Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state. What these rights and duties are varies from state to state. This relationship generally enables intervention by a State to provide help and protection to its nationals when they are harmed by other States. By custom and international conventions, it is the right of each state to determine who its nationals are. Such determinations are part of nationality law. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by public international law—for example, by treaties on statelessness and the European Convention on Nationality. Nationality differs technically and legally from citizenship, which is a different legal relationship between a person and a country. The noun national can include both citizens and non-citizens. The most common distinguishing feature of citizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the political life of the state, such as by voting or standing for election. However, in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the state, and full citizens are always nationals of the state. In older texts the word nationality , rather than ethnicity , is often used to refer to an ethnic group . This older meaning of nationality is not defined by political borders or passport ownership and includes nations that lack an independent state . Individuals may also be considered nationals of groups with autonomous status that have ceded some power to a larger government.	relationship between an individual human and a state	wikipedia

Citizenship	citizenship	Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law of a sovereign state as a member of or belonging to the state. Each state is free to determine the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. The status of citizenship does not of itself create any rights in a person not bestowed or recognised by the state. The idea of citizenship has been defined as the capacity of individuals to defend their rights in front of the governmental authority. In general, the main rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country and to work there. Some countries permit its citizens to have multiple citizenships, while others insist on exclusive allegiance. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless, while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander. Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation . In some countries, e.g. the United States, the United Kingdom, nationality and citizenship can have different meanings.	denotes the link between a person and a state or an association of states.	wikipedia

Alma mater	alma mater	"Alma mater almae matres ) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university, school, or college that one formerly attended. In US usage, it can also mean the school from which one graduated. The phrase is variously translated as ""nourishing mother"", ""nursing mother"", or ""fostering mother"", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students. Before its current usage, alma mater was an honorific title for various Latin mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele, and later in Catholicism for the Virgin Mary. It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum , which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus , a term used for a university graduate that literally means a ""nursling"" or ""one who is nourished"". *: literal translation"	school or university that a person has attended	wikipedia

Known for	know	"Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts , skills , or objects . Knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many difference sources, including but not limited to experience, education, reason, memory, scientific inquiry, exploration, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit or explicit ; formal or informal; systematic or particular. The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus , leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief"". The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century."	experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning; theoretical or practical understanding of a subject	wikipedia

Children	children	"Biologically, a child is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty. The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority. Children generally have fewer rights and less responsibility than adults. They are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must be under the care of their parents or another responsible caregiver. Child may also describe a relationship with a parent or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in ""a child of nature"" or ""a child of the Sixties""."	human between the stages of birth and puberty	wikipedia

Awards	awards	An award , sometimes called a distinction , is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field. When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration. An award may be described by three aspects: 1) who is given 2) what 3) by whom, all varying according to purpose. The recipient is often a single person or else a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country. The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal , badge, ribbon or pin. It can also be a token object such as prize, trophy or commemorative plaque. The award may also be or be accompanied by a title, certificate or diploma, as well as an object of direct value such as money or a scholarship. Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way. An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority , or else a private organisation or individual. The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards. For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize. Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests. The Stanley Cup is a modern example. In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces.. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient. Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory. There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools. A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations.	something given to a person or a group of people to recognize their merit or excellence	wikipedia

Institutions	institutions	"Institutions , according to Samuel P. Huntington, are ""stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior"". Further, institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community; moreover, institutions are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior. According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior. Instead, Hodgson states that institutions are ""integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions"". The term ""institution"" commonly applies to both informal institutions such as customs, or behavior patterns important to a society, and to particular formal institutions created by entities such as the government and public services. Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family that are broad enough to encompass other institutions. Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology . Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement."	structure or mechanism of social order and cooperation governing the behaviour of a set of individuals within a given community	wikipedia

In the broader sense, a student is anyone who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such mastery is basic or decisive.
