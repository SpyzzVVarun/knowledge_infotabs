Creation of the Sultanate	sultanate	"Sultan ) is a position with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning ""strength"", ""authority"", ""rulership"", derived from the verbal noun سلطة sulṭah , meaning ""authority"" or ""power"" . Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms , albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjective form of the word is ""sultanic"", and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate . The term is distinct from king , despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. The use of ""sultan"" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular king , which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. In recent years, ""sultan"" has been gradually replaced by ""king"" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957."	noble title with several historical meanings	wikipedia

Bruneian Empire	empire	An empire is a sovereign state functioning as an aggregate of lands and peoples that are ruled over by an emperor-like monarch or oligarchy. The territory and population of an empire is commonly of greater extent. History's largest empires, such as the Roman, British and Mongol empires, were typically characterized by the conquest, colonization, plunder, and subordination of often large numbers of territories, kingdoms, ethnicities, and nations, for the benefit of the empire's central rulers and economic elites. States can be empires either by narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by broad definition as stated above being an aggregated realm under a supreme authority. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro- Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise , a political organisation controlled by a single individual , or a group . The word empire is associated with such other words as imperialism , colonialism , and globalization , with imperialism being a specific form of rule and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used to describe a displeasure to overpowering situations. There are two main ways to establishe and maintain an imperial political structure: as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion. Territorial empires tend to be contiguous areas. The term, on occasion, has been applied to maritime republics or thalassocracies with looser structures and more scattered territories. Empires like the Holy Roman Empire can also come together by electing the emperor with votes from member realms.	geographically extensive group of states and peoples united and ruled either by a central authority or a central figure	wikipedia

British protected state	british protected state	British protectorates were territories over which the British government exercised only limited jurisdiction. Many territories which became British protectorates already had local rulers with whom the Crown negotiated through treaty, acknowledging their status whilst simultaneously offering protection. British protectorates were therefore governed by indirect rule. In most cases, the local ruler, as well as the subjects of the ruler, were not British subjects. British protected states represented a more loose form of British suzerainty, where the local rulers retained absolute control over the states' internal affairs and the British exercised control over defence and foreign affairs.	territory over which the British Crown exercised sovereign jurisdiction	wikipedia
