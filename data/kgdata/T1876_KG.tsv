Birth name	birth name	The birth name is the name of the person given upon their birth. The term may be applied to the surname, the given name or to the entire name. Where births are required to be officially registered, the entire name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become the person's legal name. The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairsâ€”either throughout life, or until marriage. Some possible changes concern middle names, diminutive forms, changes relating to parental status , and changes related to gender transition. Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only, rather than for life.	last name acquired at birth or (in some jurisdictions) at least otherwise than by marriage	wikipedia

Education	education	Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.

Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education.	learning in which knowledge and skills are transferred through teaching	wikipedia

Height	height	"Height is measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent or vertical position . For example, ""The height of that building is 50 m"" or ""The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m"". When the term is used to describe vertical position from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth , then altitude is called elevation. In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis between a specific point and another that does not have the same y -value. If both points happen to have the same y -value, then their relative height is zero. In three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from the x-y plane."	distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object	wikipedia

Political party	political party	A political party is an organized group of people who have the same ideology, or who otherwise have the same political positions, and who field candidates for elections, in an attempt to get them elected and thereby implement the party's agenda. They are a defining element of representative democracy. While there is some international commonality in the way political parties are recognized and in how they operate, there are often many differences, and some are significant. Most of political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent ideologies very different from their ideology at the time the party was founded. Many countries, such as Germany and India, have several significant political parties, and some nations have one-party systems, such as China and Cuba. The United States is in practice a two-party system but with many smaller parties also participating.	organization that seeks to influence government policy and actions	wikipedia
