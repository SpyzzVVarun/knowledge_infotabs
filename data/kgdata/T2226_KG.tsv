Atomic number (Z)	atomic number	The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons. The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons N gives the mass number A of an atom. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass units , is within 1% of the whole number A. Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers, and hence different mass numbers, are known as isotopes. A little more than three- quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century. The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Z ahl meaning number , which, before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word Atom z ahl come into common use in this context.	number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom	wikipedia

Element category	element category	"There are currently 118 known chemical elements exhibiting many different physical and chemical properties. Amongst this diversity, scientists have found it useful to use names for various sets of elements, that illustrate similar properties, or their trends of properties. Many of these sets are formally recognized by the standards body IUPAC. The following collective names are recommended by IUPAC: * Alkali metals – The metals of group 1: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr. * Alkaline earth metals – The metals of group 2: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra. * Pnictogens – The elements of group 15: N, P, As, Sb, Bi. * Chalcogens – The elements of group 16: O, S, Se, Te, Po. * Halogens – The elements of group 17: F, Cl, Br, I, At. * Noble gases – The elements of group 18: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn. * Lanthanides – Elements 57–71: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu. * Actinides – Elements 89–103: Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No, Lr. * Rare-earth metals – Sc, Y, plus the lanthanoids. * Transition elements – Elements in groups 3 to 11 or 3 to 12. Another common classification is by degree of metallic – metalloidal – nonmetallic behaviour and characteristics. There is no general agreement on the name to use for these sets: in this English Wikipedia, the name used is ""category"". Very often these categories are marked by a background color in the periodic table. Category names used here, without any claim to universality, are: * Alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and noble gases: Same as the IUPAC system above. * Transition elements are instead referred to as transition metals. * Lanthanoids and actinoids are instead referred to as lanthanides and actinides respectively. * Rare-earth elements, pnictogens, chalcogens, and halogens are not used as category names, but the latter three are valid as group names. * Additional element category names used: * Post-transition metals – The metals of groups 12–18: Zn, Cd, Hg, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, Bi, Po. The period 7 elements Nh, Fl, Mc, Lv, and Ts are additionally predicted to be post-transition metals, and Og may be one as well. * Metalloids – Elements with properties intermediate between metals and non-metals: B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, At. * Reactive nonmetals – Nonmetals that are chemically active : H, C, N, P, O, S, Se, F, Cl, Br, I * Superactinides – Hypothetical series of elements 121 to 157, which includes a predicted ""g-block"" of the periodic table. Many other names for sets of elements are in common use, and yet others have been used throughout history. These sets usually do not aim to cover the whole periodic table . Some examples: * Precious metals – Variously-defined group of non-radioactive metals of high economical value. * Coinage metals – Various metals used to mint coins, primarily the group 11 elements Cu, Ag, and Au. * Platinum group – Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt. * Noble metal – Variously-defined group of metals that are generally resistant to corrosion. Usually includes Ag, Au, and the platinum-group metals. * Heavy metals – Variously-defined group of metals, on the base of their density, atomic number, or toxicity. * Native metals – Metals that occur pure in nature, including the noble metals and others such as Sn and Pb. * Earth metal – Old historic term, usually referred to the metals of groups 3 and 13, although sometimes others such as beryllium and chromium are included as well. * Transuranium elements – Elements with atomic number greater than 92. * Transactinide elements – Elements after the actinides . * Transplutonium elements – Elements with atomic number greater than 94. * Minor actinides – Actinides found in significant quantities in nuclear fuel, other than U and Pu: Np, Am, Cm. * Heavy atom – term used in computational chemistry to refer to any element other than hydrogen and helium."	group of chemical elements	wikipedia

Electron configuration	electron configuration	In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6, using the notation explained below. Electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by all other orbitals. Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, for systems with only one electron, a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration and in certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon. Knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements. This is also useful for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together. In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.

Electrons per shell	electron shell	"In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus. The closest shell to the nucleus is called the ""1 shell"" , followed by the ""2 shell"" , then the ""3 shell"" , and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation . Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 and so on. The general formula is that the n th shell can in principle hold up to 2 electrons. For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration. Each shell consists of one or more subshells , and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals."	principal energy levels in atomic physics	wikipedia

Melting point	melting point	"The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa. When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of some substances to supercool, the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance. When the ""characteristic freezing point"" of a substance is determined, in fact the actual methodology is almost always ""the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point."	temperature at which a solid turns liquid	wikipedia

Boiling point	boiling point	The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor. The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 100 °C at sea level, but at 93.4 °C at 1,905 metres altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures. The normal boiling point of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, one atmosphere. At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar. The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure . Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.	temperature at which a substance changes from solid into vapor	wikipedia

Density (near r.t.)	density	"The density , of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ , although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: ρ = m V {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}} where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases , density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity ""relative density"" or ""specific gravity"", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water. The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material. The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass."	mass per volume	wikipedia

when liquid (at m.p.)	liquid	A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter , and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form as interstellar clouds or in plasma from within stars.	liquid object	wikipedia

Heat of fusion	heat of fusion	The enthalpy of fusion of a substance, also known as heat of fusion is the change in its enthalpy resulting from providing energy, typically heat, to a specific quantity of the substance to change its state from a solid to a liquid, at constant pressure. For example, when melting 1 kg of ice , 333.55 kJ of energy is absorbed with no temperature change. The heat of solidification is equal and opposite. This energy includes the contribution required to make room for any associated change in volume by displacing its environment against ambient pressure. The temperature at which the phase transition occurs is the melting point or the freezing point, according to context. By convention, the pressure is assumed to be 1 atm unless otherwise specified.	enthalpy	wikipedia

Heat of vaporization	heat of vaporization	The enthalpy of vaporization , also known as the heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation , is the amount of energy that must be added to a liquid substance, to transform a quantity of that substance into a gas. The enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the pressure at which that transformation takes place. The enthalpy of vaporization is often quoted for the normal boiling temperature of the substance; although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298 K, that correction is often smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value. The heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent, though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperature T r {\displaystyle T{r}} ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \ll 1} . The heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature . Above the critical temperature, the liquid and vapor phases are indistinguishable, and the substance is called a supercritical fluid.	energy to convert a liquid substance to a gas; a function of pressure	wikipedia

Molar heat capacity	molar heat capacity	"The molar heat capacity of a chemical substance is the amount of energy that must be added, in the form of heat, to one mole of the substance in order to cause an increase of one unit in its temperature. Alternatively, it is the heat capacity of a sample of the substance divided by the amount of substance of the sample; or also the specific heat capacity of the substance times its molar mass. The SI unit of specific heat is joule per kelvin per mole, J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. Like the specific heat, measured the molar heat capacity of a substance, especially a gas, may be significantly higher when the sample is allowed to expand as it is heated than when is heated in a closed vessel that prevents expansion . The ratio between the two, however, is the same heat capacity ratio obtained from the corresponding specific heat capacities. This property is most relevant in chemistry, when amounts of substances are often specified in moles rather than by mass or volume. The molar heat capacity generally increases with the molar mass, often varies with temperature and pressure, and is different for each state of matter. For example, at atmospheric pressure, the molar heat capacity of water just above the melting point is about 76 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1, but that of ice just below that point is about 37.84 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. While the substance is undergoing a phase transition, such as melting or boiling, its molar heat capacity is technically infinite, because the heat goes into changing its state rather than raising its temperature. The concept is not appropriate for substances whose precise composition is not known, or whose molar mass is not well defined, such as polymers and oligomers of indeterminate molecular size. A closely related property of a substance is the heat capacity per mole of atoms , or atom-molar heat capacity , in which the heat capacity of the sample is divided by the number of moles of atoms instead of moles of molecules. So, for example, the atom-molar heat capacity of water is 1/3 of its molar heat capacity, namely 25.3 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. In informal chemistry contexts, the molar heat capacity may be called just ""heat capacity"" or ""specific heat"". However, international standards now recommend that ""specific heat capacity"" always refer to capacity per unit of mass, to avoid possible confusion. Therefore, the word ""molar"", not ""specific"", should always be used for this quantity."	intensive quantity, heat capacity per amount of substance	wikipedia

Oxidation states	oxidation states	"The oxidation state , sometimes referred to as oxidation number , describes the degree of oxidation of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state, which may be positive, negative or zero, is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic, with no covalent component. This is never exactly true for real bonds. The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost, regardless of whether oxygen was involved. Oxidation states are typically represented by integers which may be positive, zero, or negative. In some cases, the average oxidation state of an element is a fraction, such as 8/3 for iron in magnetite . The highest known oxidation state is reported to be +9 in the tetroxoiridium cation . It is predicted that even a +10 oxidation state may be achievable by platinum in the tetroxoplatinum cation . The lowest oxidation state is −5, as for boron in Al3BC. The increase in oxidation state of an atom, through a chemical reaction, is known as an oxidation; a decrease in oxidation state is known as a reduction. Such reactions involve the formal transfer of electrons: a net gain in electrons being a reduction, and a net loss of electrons being an oxidation. For pure elements, the oxidation state is zero. The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property. This is particularly true of high oxidation states, where the ionization energy required to produce a multiply positive ion is far greater than the energies available in chemical reactions. Additionally, oxidation states of atoms in a given compound may vary depending on the choice of electronegativity scale used in their calculation. Thus, the oxidation state of an atom in a compound is purely a formalism. It is nevertheless important in understanding the nomenclature conventions of inorganic compounds. Also, a number of observations pertaining to chemical reactions may be explained at a basic level in terms of oxidation states. In inorganic nomenclature, the oxidation state is represented by a Roman numeral placed after the element name inside a parenthesis or as a superscript after the element symbol."	number that describes degree of oxidation of an atom in a chemical compound; the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were fully ionic	wikipedia

Electronegativity	electronegativity	"Electronegativity , symbol χ , is a concept that describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons towards itself. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons towards itself. On the most basic level, electronegativity is determined by factors like the nuclear charge and the number/location of other electrons present in the atomic shells . The opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity : a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons. The term ""electronegativity"" was introduced by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1811, though the concept was known even before that and was studied by many chemists including Avogadro. In spite of its long history, an accurate scale of electronegativity was not developed until 1932, when Linus Pauling proposed an electronegativity scale, which depends on bond energies, as a development of valence bond theory. It has been shown to correlate with a number of other chemical properties. Electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties. Several methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity, all methods show the same periodic trends between elements. The most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, commonly referred to as the Pauling scale , on a relative scale running from 0.79 to 3.98 . When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units. As it is usually calculated, electronegativity is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule. Properties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity. It is to be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment, but it is usually considered to be a transferable property, that is to say that similar values will be valid in a variety of situations. Caesium is the least electronegative element in the periodic table , while fluorine is most electronegative . Francium and caesium were originally both assigned 0.7; caesium's value was later refined to 0.79, but no experimental data allows a similar refinement for francium. However, francium's ionization energy is known to be slightly higher than caesium's, in accordance with the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital, and this in turn implies that francium is in fact more electronegative than caesium."	chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself	wikipedia

Ionization energies	ionization energies	In physics and chemistry, ionization energy or ionisation energy , denoted E i, is the minimum amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence electron, of an isolated neutral gaseous atom or molecule. It is quantitatively expressed as X + energy → X+ + e− where X is any atom or molecule capable of ionization, X+ is that atom or molecule with an electron removed, and e− is the removed electron. This is generally an endothermic process. Generally, the closer the outermost electrons to the nucleus of the atom, the higher the atom's or element's ionization energy. The sciences of physics and chemistry use different measures of ionization energy. In physics, the unit is the amount of energy required to remove a single electron from a single atom or molecule, expressed as electronvolts. In chemistry, the unit is the amount of energy required for all of the atoms in a mole of substance to lose one electron each: molar ionization energy or enthalpy, expressed as kilojoules per mole or kilocalories per mole . Comparison of E i of elements in the periodic table reveals two periodic trends: 1. E i generally increases as one moves from left to right within a given period . 2. E i generally decreases as one moves from top to bottom in a given group . The latter trend results from the outer electron shell being progressively farther from the nucleus, with the addition of one inner shell per row as one moves down the column. The n th ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the species having a charge of . For example, the first three ionization energies are defined as follows: 1st ionization energy X → X+ \+ e− 2nd ionization energy X+ → X2+ \+ e− 3rd ionization energy X2+ → X3+ \+ e− The term ionization potential is an older name for ionization energy, because the oldest method of measuring ionization energy was based on ionizing a sample and accelerating the electron removed using an electrostatic potential. However this term is now considered obsolete. Some factors affecting the ionization energy include: 1. Nuclear charge: if the nuclear charge is greater, the electrons are held more tightly by the nucleus and hence the ionization energy will be greater. 2. Number of electron shells: if the size of the atom is greater due to the presence of more shells, the electrons are held less tightly by the nucleus and the ionization energy will be less. 3. Effective nuclear charge : if the magnitude of electron shielding and penetration are greater, the electrons are held less tightly by the nucleus, the Z eff of the electron and the ionization energy are smaller. 4. Type of orbital ionized: an atom having a more stable electronic configuration has less tendency to lose electrons and consequently has high ionization energy. 5. Orbital occupancy of the orbital: if the orbital is half or completely filled, then it is harder to remove electrons.	minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom or molecule in the gaseous state	wikipedia

Atomic radius	atomic radius	The atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding shells of electrons. Since the boundary is not a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius. Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are: Van der Waals radius, ionic radius, and covalent radius. Depending on the definition, the term may apply only to isolated atoms, or also to atoms in condensed matter, covalently bonding in molecules, or in ionized and excited states; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements, or computed from theoretical models. The value of the radius may depend on the atom's state and context. Electrons do not have definite orbits, or sharply defined ranges. Rather, their positions must be described as probability distributions that taper off gradually as one moves away from the nucleus, without a sharp cutoff. Moreover, in condensed matter and molecules, the electron clouds of the atoms usually overlap to some extent, and some of the electrons may roam over a large region encompassing two or more atoms. Under most definitions the radii of isolated neutral atoms range between 30 and 300 pm , or between 0.3 and 3 ångströms. Therefore, the radius of an atom is more than 10,000 times the radius of its nucleus , and less than 1/1000 of the wavelength of visible light . For many purposes, atoms can be modeled as spheres. This is only a crude approximation, but it can provide quantitative explanations and predictions for many phenomena, such as the density of liquids and solids, the diffusion of fluids through molecular sieves, the arrangement of atoms and ions in crystals, and the size and shape of molecules. Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explicable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group . The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory. The atomic radii decrease across the Periodic Table because as the atomic number increases, the number of protons increases across the period, but the extra electrons are only added to the same quantum shell. Therefore, the effective nuclear charge towards the outermost electrons increases, drawing the outermost electrons closer. As a result, the electron cloud contracts and the atomic radius decreases.	size Is directly proportional to radius.	wikipedia

Covalent radius	covalent radius	The covalent radius , r cov, is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond. It is usually measured either in picometres or angstroms , with 1 Å = 100 pm. In principle, the sum of the two covalent radii should equal the covalent bond length between two atoms, R = r + r . Moreover, different radii can be introduced for single, double and triple bonds , in a purely operational sense. These relationships are certainly not exact because the size of an atom is not constant but depends on its chemical environment. For heteroatomic A–B bonds, ionic terms may enter. Often the polar covalent bonds are shorter than would be expected on the basis of the sum of covalent radii. Tabulated values of covalent radii are either average or idealized values, which nevertheless show a certain transferability between different situations, which makes them useful. The bond lengths R are measured by X-ray diffraction . Rotational spectroscopy can also give extremely accurate values of bond lengths. For homonuclear A–A bonds, Linus Pauling took the covalent radius to be half the single-bond length in the element, e.g. R = 74.14 pm so r cov = 37.07 pm: in practice, it is usual to obtain an average value from a variety of covalent compounds, although the difference is usually small. Sanderson has published a recent set of non-polar covalent radii for the main-group elements, but the availability of large collections of bond lengths, which are more transferable, from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database has rendered covalent radii obsolete in many situations.	measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond	wikipedia

Natural occurrence	natural	"Nature , in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. ""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura , or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"". In ancient philosophy, Natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis , which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers , and has steadily gained currency ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history . However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin. Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural."	Natural, physical, or material world and its phenomena	wikipedia
Natural occurrence	occurrence	"The type–token distinction is the difference between naming a class of objects and naming the individual instances of that class. Since each type may be represented by multiple tokens, there are generally more tokens than types of an object. For example, the sentence ""A rose is a rose is a rose"" contains three word types, ""a"", ""rose"", and ""is""; and eight word tokens of those types, ""a"", ""rose"", ""is"", ""a"", ""rose"", ""is"", ""a"", ""rose"". The distinction is important in disciplines such as logic, linguistics, metalogic, typography, and computer programming."	distinction that separates a concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept	wikipedia

Speed of sound thin rod	speed	In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of the change of its position; it is thus a scalar quantity. The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second, but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour. For air and marine travel the knot is commonly used. The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second . Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.	magnitude of velocity of motion	wikipedia
Speed of sound thin rod	sound	In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. In human physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain.

In air at atmospheric pressure, these represent sound waves with wavelengths of 17 meters to 1.7 centimetres . Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and are not audible to humans. Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound. Different animal species have varying hearing ranges.	mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a medium, composed of frequencies within hearing range	wikipedia

Thermal expansion	thermal expansion	Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change its shape, area, and volume in response to a change in temperature. Temperature is a monotonic function of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance. When a substance is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases. Thus, the molecules begin vibrating/moving more and usually maintain a greater average separation. Materials which contract with increasing temperature are unusual; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges . The relative expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of linear thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature.	tendency of matter to change volume in response to a change in temperature	wikipedia

Thermal conductivity	thermal conductivity	The thermal conductivity of a material is a measure of its ability to conduct heat. It is commonly denoted by k {\displaystyle k} , λ {\displaystyle \lambda } , or κ {\displaystyle \kappa } . Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate in materials of low thermal conductivity than in materials of high thermal conductivity. For instance, metals typically have high thermal conductivity and are very efficient at conducting heat, while the opposite is true for insulating materials like Styrofoam. Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications, and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity. The defining equation for thermal conductivity is q = − k ∇ T {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =-k\nabla T} , where q {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} } is the heat flux, k {\displaystyle k} is the thermal conductivity, and ∇ T {\displaystyle \nabla T} is the temperature gradient. This is known as Fourier's Law for heat conduction. Although commonly expressed as a scalar, the most general form of thermal conductivity is a second-rank tensor. However, the tensorial description only becomes necessary in materials which are anisotropic.	capacity of a material to conduct heat	wikipedia

Electrical resistivity	electrical resistivity	Electrical resistivity and its inverse, electrical conductivity, is a fundamental property of a material that quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ . The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter . For example, if a 1 m × 1 m × 1 m solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is 1 Ω, then the resistivity of the material is 1 Ω⋅m. Electrical conductivity or specific conductance is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity. It represents a material's ability to conduct electric current. It is commonly signified by the Greek letter σ , but κ and γ are sometimes used. The SI unit of electrical conductivity is siemens per metre .	fundamental property that quantifies how readily a given material allows the flow of electric current	wikipedia

Magnetic ordering	magnetic ordering	Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomenon of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt and nickel and their alloys. The prefix ferro- refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4. All substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminum and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic. The magnetic state of a material depends on temperature, pressure, and the applied magnetic field. A material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism as these variables change. The strength of a magnetic field almost always decreases with distance, though the exact mathematical relationship between strength and distance varies. Different configurations of magnetic moments and electric currents can result in complicated magnetic fields. Only magnetic dipoles have been observed, although some theories predict the existence of magnetic monopoles.	class of physical phenomena	wikipedia

Magnetic susceptibility	magnetic susceptibility	In electromagnetism, the magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how much a material will become magnetized in an applied magnetic field. It is the ratio of magnetization M to the applied magnetizing field intensity H. This allows a simple classification, into two categories, of most materials' responses to an applied magnetic field: an alignment with the magnetic field, χ > 0, called paramagnetism, or an alignment against the field, χ < 0, called diamagnetism. Magnetic susceptibility indicates whether a material is attracted into or repelled out of a magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials align with the applied field and are attracted to regions of greater magnetic field. Diamagnetic materials are anti-aligned and are pushed away, toward regions of lower magnetic fields. On top of the applied field, the magnetization of the material adds its own magnetic field, causing the field lines to concentrate in paramagnetism, or be excluded in diamagnetism. Quantitative measures of the magnetic susceptibility also provide insights into the structure of materials, providing insight into bonding and energy levels. Furthermore, it is widely used in geology for paleomagnetic studies and structural geology. The magnetizability of materials comes from the atomic-level magnetic properties of the particles of which they are made. Usually, this is dominated by the magnetic moments of electrons. Electrons are present in all materials, but without any external magnetic field, the magnetic moments of the electrons are usually either paired up or random so that the overall magnetism is zero . The fundamental reasons why the magnetic moments of the electrons line up or do not are very complex and cannot be explained by classical physics . However, a useful simplification is to measure the magnetic susceptibility of a material and apply the macroscopic form of Maxwell's equations. This allows classical physics to make useful predictions while avoiding the underlying quantum mechanical details.	measure of how much a material will become magnetized in an applied magnetic field	wikipedia

For a fluid, only the bulk modulus is meaningful. For a complex anisotropic solid such as wood or paper, these three moduli do not contain enough information to describe its behaviour, and one must use the full generalized Hooke's law.	measure of how incompressible / resistant to compressibility a substance is	wikipedia

For small values of these changes, ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the amount of transversal expansion divided by the amount of axial compression. Most materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging between 0.0 and 0.5. Incompressible materials such as rubber, have a ratio near 0.5. The ratio is named after the French mathematician and physicist Siméon Poisson.	parameter that characterizes the elastic properties of a material: the ratio of transverse strain to axial strain	wikipedia

Vickers hardness	vickers hardness	The Vickers hardness test was developed in 1921 by Robert L. Smith and George E. Sandland at Vickers Ltd as an alternative to the Brinell method to measure the hardness of materials. The Vickers test is often easier to use than other hardness tests since the required calculations are independent of the size of the indenter, and the indenter can be used for all materials irrespective of hardness. The basic principle, as with all common measures of hardness, is to observe a material's ability to resist plastic deformation from a standard source. The Vickers test can be used for all metals and has one of the widest scales among hardness tests. The unit of hardness given by the test is known as the Vickers Pyramid Number or Diamond Pyramid Hardness . The hardness number can be converted into units of pascals, but should not be confused with pressure, which uses the same units. The hardness number is determined by the load over the surface area of the indentation and not the area normal to the force, and is therefore not pressure.		wikipedia
