Subset of	subset	In mathematics, a set A is a subset of a set B , or equivalently B is a superset of A , if A is contained in B. That is, all elements of A are also elements of B. A and B may be equal; if they are unequal, then A is a proper subset of B. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment. A is a subset of B may also be expressed as B includes A , or A is included in B. The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.	"set A is a subset of a set B, or equivalently B is a superset of A, if A is ""contained"" inside B, that is, all elements of A are also elements of B. A and B may coincide"	wikipedia

Used for		The Navy of the Russian Federation inherited the ranks of the Soviet Navy, although the insignia and uniform were slightly altered. The navy predominantly uses naval-style ranks but also uses army-style ranks for some specialisations, including naval aviation, marine infantry, medical and legal.		wikipedia
