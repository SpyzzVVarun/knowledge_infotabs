Years	years	A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked. A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar. The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars; see below. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard ISO 80000-3, Annex C, supports the symbol a to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used. In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds , totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year. The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc. Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year.	estimated period of time for the Earth's orbit around the Sun and observed at a fixed geographic point, lasting about 365.25 days on average to the nearest half day; base later modified to define or adjust various calendars	wikipedia

2002-2003		The Duchy of Normandy grew out of the 911 Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the Viking leader Rollo. The duchy was named for its inhabitants, the Normans. From 1066 until 1204, as a result of the Norman conquest of England, the kings of England were also dukes of Normandy, with the exception of Robert Curthose , eldest son of William the Conqueror but unsuccessful claimant to the English throne; and Geoffrey Plantagenet , husband of Empress Matilda and father of Henry II. In 1202, Philip II of France declared Normandy forfeit to him and seized it by force of arms in 1204. It remained disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259, when the English sovereign ceded his claim except for the Channel Islands; i.e., the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, and their dependencies . In the Kingdom of France, the duchy was occasionally set apart as an appanage to be ruled by a member of the royal family. After 1469, however, it was permanently united to the royal domain, although the title was occasionally conferred as an honorific upon junior members of the royal family. The last French duke of Normandy in this sense was Louis-Charles, duke from 1785 to 1789.	dukedom of France	wikipedia
2003-2009		George Henry Hotchkiss was an American professional basketball coach for the Oshkosh All-Stars in the United States' National Basketball League . He was the NBL Coach of the Year in 1940–41. During Hotchkiss' tenure, the All-Stars transitioned from being a barnstorming team in 1936–37 to a perennial NBL powerhouse, winning four straight regular season division or league titles from 1938 to 1941, made four straight NBL championship series appearances in that span, and won the league championship in 1941. He stepped down as coach after that season. As a player, Hotchkiss played football and basketball for the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s. In basketball, he was named to the All-Big Ten Conference second-team as a senior in 1927–28. He then played for the Oshkosh All-Stars prior to the formation of the NBL in 1937–38. In his post-basketball career, Hotchkiss was a self-employed insurance agent for Northwestern Mutual.	American basketball coach	wikipedia
