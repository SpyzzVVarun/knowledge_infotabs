Birth name	birth name	The birth name is the name of the person given upon their birth. The term may be applied to the surname, the given name or to the entire name. Where births are required to be officially registered, the entire name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become the person's legal name. The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairsâ€”either throughout life, or until marriage. Some possible changes concern middle names, diminutive forms, changes relating to parental status , and changes related to gender transition. Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only, rather than for life.	last name acquired at birth or (in some jurisdictions) at least otherwise than by marriage	wikipedia

Alma mater	alma mater	"Alma mater almae matres ) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university, school, or college that one formerly attended. In US usage, it can also mean the school from which one graduated. The phrase is variously translated as ""nourishing mother"", ""nursing mother"", or ""fostering mother"", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students. Before its current usage, alma mater was an honorific title for various Latin mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele, and later in Catholicism for the Virgin Mary. It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum , which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus , a term used for a university graduate that literally means a ""nursling"" or ""one who is nourished"". *: literal translation"	school or university that a person has attended	wikipedia

Known for	know	"Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts , skills , or objects . Knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many difference sources, including but not limited to experience, education, reason, memory, scientific inquiry, exploration, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit or explicit ; formal or informal; systematic or particular. The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus , leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief"". The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century."	experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning; theoretical or practical understanding of a subject	wikipedia

They are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must be under the care of their parents or another responsible caregiver. Child may also describe a relationship with a parent or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in ""a child of nature"" or ""a child of the Sixties""."	human between the stages of birth and puberty	wikipedia
