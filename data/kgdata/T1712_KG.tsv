Manufacturer	manufacturer	Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation, and is the essence of secondary industry. The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part. Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead. The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design. Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, General Dynamics, Boeing, Pfizer Precision Castparts And FCA. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group, Siemens, FCA and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Yamaha, Panasonic, LG, Samsung and Tata Motors.	industrial activity producing goods for sale using labor and machines	wikipedia

Alcohol by volume	alcohol by volume	Alcohol by volume is a standard measure of how much alcohol is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage . It is defined as the number of millilitres of pure ethanol present in 100 mL of solution at 20 °C . The number of millilitres of pure ethanol is the mass of the ethanol divided by its density at 20 °C, which is 0.78924 g/mL . The ABV standard is used worldwide. The International Organization of Legal Metrology has tables of density of water–ethanol mixtures at different concentrations and temperatures. In some countries, e.g. France, alcohol by volume is often referred to as degrees Gay-Lussac , although there is a slight difference since the Gay-Lussac convention uses the International Standard Atmosphere value for temperature, 15 °C .

Original gravity	original gravity	"Gravity , in the context of fermenting alcoholic beverages, refers to the specific gravity, or relative density compared to water, of the wort or must at various stages in the fermentation. The concept is used in the brewing and wine-making industries. Specific gravity is measured by a hydrometer, refractometer, pycnometer or oscillating U-tube electronic meter. The density of a wort is largely dependent on the sugar content of the wort. During alcohol fermentation, yeast converts sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol. The decline in the sugar content and the presence of ethanol drop the density of the wort. The percentage of alcohol can be calculated from the difference between the original gravity of the wort and the current specific gravity of wort. By monitoring the decline in SG over time the brewer obtains information about the health and progress of the fermentation and determines that it is complete when gravity stops declining. If the fermentation is finished, the specific gravity is called the final gravity . For example, for a typical strength beer, OG could be 1.050 and FG could be 1.010. Several different scales have been used for measuring the original gravity. For historical reasons, the brewing industry largely uses the Plato scale , which is essentially the same as the Brix scale used by the wine industry. For example, OG 1.050 is roughly equivalent to 12°P. By considering the original gravity, the brewer or vintner obtains an indication as to the probable ultimate alcoholic content of their product. The OE is often referred to as the ""size"" of the beer and is, in Europe, often printed on the label as Stammwürze or sometimes just as a per cent. In the Czech Republic, for example, common descriptions are ""10 degree beers"", ""12 degree beers"" which refers to the gravity in Plato of the wort before the fermentation."	technical term; relative density compared to water, of the wort or must at various stages in the fermentation of alcoholic beverages	wikipedia
