Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions and volume is a measure of three dimensions .	measured dimension of an object in a physical space	wikipedia

In some countries the term is used to describe political patronage , which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support.
