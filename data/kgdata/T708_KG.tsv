Years active	year	A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked. A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar. The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars; see below. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard ISO 80000-3, Annex C, supports the symbol a to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used. In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds , totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year. The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc. Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year.	estimated period of time for the Earth's orbit around the Sun and observed at a fixed geographic point, lasting about 365.25 days on average to the nearest half day; base later modified to define or adjust various calendars	wikipedia

Spouse(s)	spouse	A spouse is a significant other in a marriage, civil union, or common-law marriage. The term is gender neutral, whereas a male spouse is a husband and a female spouse is a wife. Although a spouse is a form of significant other, the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.	partner in a marriage, civil union, domestic partnership or common-law marriage	wikipedia

Children	children	"Biologically, a child is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty. The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority. Children generally have fewer rights and less responsibility than adults. They are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must be under the care of their parents or another responsible caregiver. Child may also describe a relationship with a parent or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in ""a child of nature"" or ""a child of the Sixties""."	human between the stages of birth and puberty	wikipedia

Billed height	height	"Height is measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent or vertical position . For example, ""The height of that building is 50 m"" or ""The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m"". When the term is used to describe vertical position from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth , then altitude is called elevation. In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis between a specific point and another that does not have the same y -value. If both points happen to have the same y -value, then their relative height is zero. In three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from the x-y plane."	distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object	wikipedia

Trained by	train	"A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad track to transport passengers or cargo . The word ""train"" comes from the Old French trahiner , derived from the Latin trahere meaning ""to pull"" or ""to draw"". Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit. The term ""engine"" is often used as an alternative to locomotive. Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch, run downhill using gravity, or powered by pneumatics, gas turbines or batteries. The track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing, which may be supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails. Monorails and maglev guideways are also used occasionally. A passenger train includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast. High-speed rail service began expanding rapidly in the late 20th century, and is also a major subject of further development. The term ""light rail"" is sometimes used to refer to a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system. A freight train uses freight cars to transport goods or materials . It is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a mixed consist. Rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks, are termed ""maintenance of way"" equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection."	form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles	wikipedia
